Array.each.js
=============

A really quick Javascript helper file that adds an each() method to array's, allowing you to loop through them without any extra complications of making your own _for_ loops. Simple but effective.

It's really easy to put into your page - you can get it straight from GitHub:

	<script type="text/javascript" src="http://timrogers.github.com/array.each.js/array.each.js"></script?
	
And then it's really easy to use as well!

	var fruits = ["bananas", "oranges", "pears"];
	fruits.each(function(item) {
		alert("I like " + item + "!");
	});
